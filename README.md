# MATLAB implementation of multiple radars tracking of multiple targets

This repository uses a Kalman filter for target tracking. The scenario consists of two radars and four targets. Each radar tracks four targets separately. The distributed fusion method is used to fuse the results.

Just run main.m in the folder.

The location and scanning range of the two radars are shown in the figure below.
